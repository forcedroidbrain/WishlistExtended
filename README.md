# Wishlist Extended
Wishlist Extended is a mod for SPT that expands the built-in auto-wishlist system with additional customization options.
It allows you to control which crafts and hideout upgrades are automatically wishlisted, and also adds support for automatically wishlisting items required for barters.

A more detailed description and screenshots are available on [SPT Forge](https://forge.sp-tarkov.com/mod/2500/wishlist-extended).
